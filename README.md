# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 
-This project uses express as a backend and asynchronous functions 
-It has a package.json file to explain what packages are installed 
-All you need to do is to type in the zip code in the us and it gives you the latest temperature in that area


## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.
-To use this you'll need to call the command "npm install" to install all the dependencies
needed to use this app.
-Then you'll need to run the command "node server.js"

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.
